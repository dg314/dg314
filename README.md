Hi ðŸ‘‹!

Iâ€™m a rising junior at Brown University concentrating in Applied Math-Computer Science with the AI/ML pathway.

I currently work as a Software Engineering Intern at a San Francisco-based startup called Kapwing, where I'm developing an AI video editing toolkit (scene cut detection, content-aware video resizing, background blur, etc.) with React-Redux, Flask, Express, MongoDB, FFmpeg, and the MediaPipe C++ API.
